How to Generate Word Clouds in R
Simple Steps on How and When to Use Them
The 4 Main Steps to Create Word Clouds

In the following section, I show you 4 simple steps to follow if you want to generate a word cloud with R.

STEP 1: Retrieving the data and uploading the packages

To generate word clouds, you need to download the wordcloud package in R as well as the RcolorBrewer package for the colours. Note that there is also a wordcloud2 package, with a slightly different design and fun applications. I will show you how to use both packages.

install.packages(""wordcloud"")
library(wordcloud)
install.packages(""RColorBrewer"")
library(RColorBrewer)
install.packages(""wordcloud2)
library(wordcloud2)

Most often, word clouds are used to analyse twitter data or a corpus of text. If you’re analysing twitter data, simply upload your data by using the rtweet package (see this article for more info on this). If you’re working on a speech, article or any other type of text, make sure to load your text data as a corpus. A useful way to do this is to use the tm package.

install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)
#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text
# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))
STEP 2: Clean the text data

Cleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.

If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.

gsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)

If you’re working with a corpus, there are several packages you can use to clean your text. The following lines of code show you how to do this using the tm package.

docs <- docs %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
STEP 3: Create a document-term-matrix

What you want to do as a next step is to have a dataframe containing each word in your first column and their frequency in the second column.

This can be done by creating a document term matrix with the TermDocumentMatrix function from the tm package.

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs) 
matrix <- as.matrix(dtm) 
words <- sort(rowSums(matrix),decreasing=TRUE) 
df <- data.frame(word = names(words),freq=words)

Alternatively, and especially if you’re using tweets, you can use the tidytext package.

tweets_words <-  tweets %>%
 select(text) %>%
 unnest_tokens(word, text)
words <- tweets_words %>% count(word, sort=TRUE)
STEP 4: Generate the word cloud

The wordcloud package is the most classic way to generate a word cloud. The following line of code shows you how to properly set the arguments. As an example, I chose to work with the speeches given by US Presidents at the United Nations General Assembly.

set.seed(1234) # for reproducibility 
wordcloud(words = df$word, freq = df$freq, min.freq = 1,           max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35,            colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

It may happen that your word cloud crops certain words or simply doesn’t show them. If this happens, make sure to add the argument scale=c(3.5,0.25) and play around with the numbers to make the word cloud fit.

Another common mistake with word clouds is to show too many words that have little frequency. If this is the case, make sure to adjust the minimum frequency argument (min.freq=…) in order to render your word cloud more meaningful.

The wordcloud2 package is a bit more fun to use, allowing us to do some more advanced visualisations. For instance, you can choose your wordcloud to appear in a specific shape or even letter (see this vignette for a useful tutorial). As an example, I used the same corpus of UN speeches and generated the two word clouds shown below. Cool, right?

wordcloud2(data=df, size=1.6, color='random-dark')
wordcloud2(data=df, size = 0.7, shape = 'pentagon')
3 Reasons Why You Should Use Word Clouds
Word clouds are killer visualisation tools. They present text data in a simple and clear format, that of a cloud in which the size of the words depends on their respective frequencies. As such, they are visually nice to look at as well as easy and quick to understand.
Word clouds are great communication tools. They are incredibly handy for anyone wishing to communicate a basic insight based on text data — whether it’s to analyse a speech, capture the conversation on social media or report on customer reviews.
Word clouds are insightful. Visually engaging, word clouds allow us to draw several insights quickly, allowing for some flexibility in their interpretation. Their visual format stimulates us to think and draw the best insight depending on what we wish to analyse.
So, When Should I Use Word Clouds?

Yes, word clouds are insightful, great communication and visualisation tools. Nonetheless, they also have their limits and understanding this is key to know when to use them and therefore also when not to.

Word clouds are essentially a descriptive tool. They should therefore only be used to capture basic qualitative insights. Visually attractive, they are a great tool to start a conversation, a presentation or an analysis. However, their analysis is limited to insights that simply don’t have the same calibre as more extensive statistical analysis.

I regularly write articles about Data Science and Natural Language Processing. Follow me on Twitter or Medium to check out more articles like these or simply to keep updated about the next ones. Thanks for reading!

Note that there is also a wordcloud2 package, with a slightly different design and fun applications. I will show you how to use both packages.wordcloud  RcolorBrewer wordcloud2 install.packages(""wordcloud"")

Simple Steps on How and When to Use… | by Céline Van den Rul | Towards Data Science,,,1.18,"undefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedMost often, word clouds are used to analyse twitter data or a corpus of text. If you’re analysing twitter data, simply upload your data by using the rtweet package (see this article for more info on this). If you’re working on a speech, article or any other type of text, make sure to load your text data as a corpus. A useful way to do this is to use the tm package.rtweetarticletm install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)
#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text
# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))STEP 2: Clean the text dataCleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.tweetsGet started

Simple Steps on How and When to Use… | by Céline Van den Rul | Towards Data Science,,,0.0026109660574412533,"undefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedCleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.tweetsgsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)gsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)If you’re working with a corpus, there are several packages you can use to clean your text. The following lines of code show you how to do this using the tm package.corpustmdocs <- docs %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))docs <- docs %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))STEP 3: Create a document-term-matrixWhat you want to do as a next step is to have a dataframe containing each word in your first column and their frequency in the second column.Get started

  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)

docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))STEP 3: Create a document-term-matrixWhat you want to do as a next step is to have a dataframe containing each word in your first column and their frequency in the second column.This can be done by creating a document term matrix with the TermDocumentMatrix function from the tm package. tm dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs) 
matrix <- as.matrix(dtm) 
words <- sort(rowSums(matrix),decreasing=TRUE) 
df <- data.frame(word = names(words),freq=words)dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs) 
matrix <- as.matrix(dtm) 
words <- sort(rowSums(matrix),decreasing=TRUE) 
df <- data.frame(word = names(words),freq=words)Alternatively, and especially if you’re using tweets, you can use the tidytext package.tidytext Get started

Simple Steps on How and When to Use… | by Céline Van den Rul | Towards Data Science,,,-0.007518796992481203,"undefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedCleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.tweetsgsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)gsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)If you’re working with a corpus, there are several packages you can use to clean your text. The following lines of code show you how to do this using the tm package.corpustmdocs <- docs %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))docs <- docs %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))STEP 3: Create a document-term-matrixWhat you want to do as a next step is to have a dataframe containing each word in your first column and their frequency in the second column.Get started

Note that there is also a wordcloud2 package, with a slightly different design and fun applications. I will show you how to use both packages.wordcloud  RcolorBrewer wordcloud2 install.packages(""wordcloud"")

library(wordcloud2)Most often, word clouds are used to analyse twitter data or a corpus of text. If you’re analysing twitter data, simply upload your data by using the rtweet package (see this article for more info on this). If you’re working on a speech, article or any other type of text, make sure to load your text data as a corpus. A useful way to do this is to use the tm package.rtweetarticletm install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)
#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text
# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))install.packages(""tm"")

Simple Steps on How and When to Use… | by Céline Van den Rul | Towards Data Science,,,0.003682272488164124,"undefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedTo generate word clouds, you need to download the wordcloud package in R as well as the RcolorBrewer package for the colours. Note that there is also a wordcloud2 package, with a slightly different design and fun applications. I will show you how to use both packages.wordcloud  RcolorBrewer wordcloud2 install.packages(""wordcloud"")

If you’re analysing twitter data, simply upload your data by using the rtweet package (see this article for more info on this). If you’re working on a speech, article or any other type of text, make sure to load your text data as a corpus. A useful way to do this is to use the tm package.rtweetarticletm install.packages(""tm"")

library(tm)#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))STEP 2: Clean the text dataCleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.tweetsgsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text)

Simple Steps on How and When to Use… | by Céline Van den Rul | Towards Data Science,,,-0.0033444816053511705,"undefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedMost often, word clouds are used to analyse twitter data or a corpus of text. If you’re analysing twitter data, simply upload your data by using the rtweet package (see this article for more info on this). If you’re working on a speech, article or any other type of text, make sure to load your text data as a corpus. A useful way to do this is to use the tm package.rtweetarticletm install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)
#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text
# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))STEP 2: Clean the text dataCleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.tweetsgsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)gsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text)

library(wordcloud2)Most often, word clouds are used to analyse twitter data or a corpus of text. If you’re analysing twitter data, simply upload your data by using the rtweet package (see this article for more info on this). If you’re working on a speech, article or any other type of text, make sure to load your text data as a corpus. A useful way to do this is to use the tm package.rtweetarticletm install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)
#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text
# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))install.packages(""tm"")
library(tm)#Create a vector containing only the text
text <- data$text# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))STEP 2: Clean the text dataCleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.tweetsGet started

text <- data$text# Create a corpus  
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))STEP 2: Clean the text dataCleaning is an essential step to take before you generate your wordcloud. Indeed, for your analysis to bring useful insights, you may want to remove special characters, numbers or punctuation from your text. In addition, you should remove common stop words in order to produce meaningful results and avoid the most common frequent words such as “I” or “the” to appear in the word cloud.If you’re working with tweets, use the following line of code to clean your text.tweetsgsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)gsub(""https\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""@\\S*"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""amp"", """", tweets$text) 
gsub(""[\r\n]"", """", tweets$text)
gsub(""[[:punct:]]"", """", data$text)corpusGet started

Le principe du nuage de mots est basé sur une méthode d’analyse de textes qui nous permet de mettre en évidence les mots-clés les plus fréquemment utilisés dans un paragraphe de textes. Le nuage de mots est également appelé word cloud ou tag cloud en anglais. La procédure de création d’un nuage de mots est très simple avec le logiciel R si vous connaissez les différentes étapes à exécuter. Le package tm (pour text mining) et le package wordcloud (pour générer le nuage de mots clés) sont disponibles dans R pour nous aider à analyser des textes et de visualiser rapidement les mots-clés en nuage de mots.

L’objectif de ce tutoriel est d’expliquer les différentes étapes pour générer un nuage de mots à partir du logiciel R.

3 raisons pour lesquelles vous devriez utiliser des nuages de mots pour présenter vos textes
Le nuage de mots est une méthode puissante pour l’analyse de textes. Il ajoute de la simplicité et de la clarté. Les mots-clés les plus utilisés ressortent mieux dans un nuage de mots.
Le nuage de mots est un outil de communication puissant. Il est facile à comprendre, à partager et est percutant
Le nuage de mots est visuellement plus agréable qu’une table de données remplie de textes
Qui utilise les nuages de mots?
Les chercheurs: pour la présentation des données qualitatives
Les Marketers: pour mettre en évidence les besoins et les points d’insatisfaction des clients
Les enseignants: pour soutenir des sujets essentiels
Les politiciens et les journalistes
Les réseaux sociaux: pour collecter, analyser et partager les sentiments des utilisateurs
Les cinq principales étapes de la création d’un nuage de mots avec le logiciel R
Etape 1: Créez un fichier texte

Dans les exemples suivants, je vais analyser le discours de Martin Luther King (“I have a dream”), mais vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel autre texte :

Copiez et collez le texte dans un fichier texte (par exemple: ml.txt)
Enregistrez le fichier

Notez que, le texte doit être enregistré dans un fichier au format texte simple (.txt) en utilisant votre éditeur de texte favori.

Etape 2: Installer et charger les packages nécessaires

Les packages text mining (tm) et wordcloud sont nécessaires.

Ils peuvent être installés et chargés en utilisant le code de R ci-dessous:

# Installer
install.packages(""tm"")  # pour le text mining
install.packages(""SnowballC"") # pour le text stemming
install.packages(""wordcloud"") # générateur de word-cloud 
install.packages(""RColorBrewer"") # Palettes de couleurs
# Charger
library(""tm"")
library(""SnowballC"")
library(""wordcloud"")
library(""RColorBrewer"")
Etape 3 : Exploration de textes
Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2"")) 
# Supprimer les ponctuations
docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)
# Supprimer les espaces vides supplémentaires
docs <- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace)
# Text stemming
# docs <- tm_map(docs, stemDocument)
Etape 4: Construire la matrice des mots

La matrice des mots (term-documents matrix) est une table contenant la fréquence des mots. La fonction TermDocumentMatrix() du package text mining peut être utilisée comme suit :

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
head(d, 10)
             word freq
will         will   17
freedom   freedom   13
ring         ring   12
day           day   11
dream       dream   11
let           let   11
every       every    9
able         able    8
one           one    8
together together    7
Etape 5: Générer le nuage de mots

L’importance des mots peut être illustrée par un nuage de mots comme suit:

set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.




Allez plus loin
Explorer les mots fréquents ainsi que leurs associations

Vous pouvez voir les mots les plus fréquents comme suit. L’exemple, ci-dessous, montre les mots qui sont fréquents au moins 4 fois dans le texte :

findFreqTerms(dtm, lowfreq = 4)
 [1] ""able""     ""day""      ""dream""    ""every""    ""faith""    ""free""     ""freedom""  ""let""      ""mountain"" ""nation""  
[11] ""one""      ""ring""     ""shall""    ""together"" ""will""    

Vous pouvez analyser l’association entre les mots (leur corrélation) en utilisant la fonction findAssocs(). Le code R ci-dessous identifie les mots qui sont le plus fréquemment associés à “freedom” dans le texte I have a dream :

findAssocs(dtm, terms = ""freedom"", corlimit = 0.3)
             freedom
let             0.89
ring            0.86
mississippi     0.34
mountainside    0.34
stone           0.34
every           0.32
mountain        0.32
state           0.32
Table de la fréquence des mots
head(d, 10)
             word freq
will         will   17
freedom   freedom   13
ring         ring   12
day           day   11
dream       dream   11
let           let   11
every       every    9
able         able    8
one           one    8
together together    7
Dessiner la fréquence des mots

La fréquence des 10 premiers mots est montré ci-dessous :

barplot(d[1:10,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = d[1:10,]$word,
        col =""lightblue"", main =""Most frequent words"",
        ylab = ""Word frequencies"")

Cette analyse a été réalisée avec le logiciel R (ver. 3.1.0).

Le principe du nuage de mots est basé sur une méthode d’analyse de textes qui nous permet de mettre en évidence les mots-clés les plus fréquemment utilisés dans un paragraphe de textes. Le nuage de mots est également appelé word cloud ou tag cloud en anglais. La procédure de création d’un nuage de mots est très simple avec le logiciel R si vous connaissez les différentes étapes à exécuter. Le package tm (pour text mining) et le package wordcloud (pour générer le nuage de mots clés) sont disponibles dans R pour nous aider à analyser des textes et de visualiser rapidement les mots-clés en nuage de mots.nuage de motsword cloudtag cloudlogiciel RtmwordcloudL’objectif de ce tutoriel est d’expliquer les différentes étapes pour générer un nuage de mots à partir du logiciel R.L’objectif de ce tutoriel est d’expliquer les différentes étapes pour générer un nuage de mots à partir du logiciel R.3 raisons pour lesquelles vous devriez utiliser des nuages de mots pour présenter vos textes

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2"")) 
# Supprimer les ponctuations

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2""))

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2"")) 
# Supprimer les ponctuations

# Supprimer les espaces vides supplémentaires

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2""))

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2"")) 
# Supprimer les ponctuations
docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)

L’importance des mots peut être illustrée par un nuage de mots comme suit:

set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.

L’importance des mots peut être illustrée par un nuage de mots comme suit:

set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.

m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)

L’importance des mots peut être illustrée par un nuage de mots comme suit:

set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.

Vous pouvez voir les mots les plus fréquents comme suit. L’exemple, ci-dessous, montre les mots qui sont fréquents au moins 4 fois dans le texte :

findFreqTerms(dtm, lowfreq = 4)
 [1] ""able""     ""day""      ""dream""    ""every""    ""faith""    ""free""     ""freedom""  ""let""      ""mountain"" ""nation""

La matrice des mots (term-documents matrix) est une table contenant la fréquence des mots. La fonction TermDocumentMatrix() du package text mining peut être utilisée comme suit :

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
head(d, 10)

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune.

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

text <- readLines(filePath)

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2"")) 
# Supprimer les ponctuations

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

L’importance des mots peut être illustrée par un nuage de mots comme suit:

set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.

L’importance des mots peut être illustrée par un nuage de mots comme suit:

set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais

[source]

A decision tree classifier.

Read more in the User Guide.

Parameters:
criterion{“gini”, “entropy”, “log_loss”}, default=”gini”

The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are “gini” for the Gini impurity and “log_loss” and “entropy” both for the Shannon information gain, see Mathematical formulation.

splitter{“best”, “random”}, default=”best”

The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported strategies are “best” to choose the best split and “random” to choose the best random split.

max_depthint, default=None

The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.

min_samples_splitint or float, default=2

The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

If int, then consider min_samples_split as the minimum number.

If float, then min_samples_split is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each split.

Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.

min_samples_leafint or float, default=1

The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.

If int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number.

If float, then min_samples_leaf is a fraction and ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each node.

Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.

min_weight_fraction_leaffloat, default=0.0

The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

max_featuresint, float or {“auto”, “sqrt”, “log2”}, default=None

The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

If int, then consider max_features features at each split.

If float, then max_features is a fraction and max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_)) features are considered at each split.

If “auto”, then max_features=sqrt(n_features).

If “sqrt”, then max_features=sqrt(n_features).

If “log2”, then max_features=log2(n_features).

If None, then max_features=n_features.

Deprecated since version 1.1: The ""auto"" option was deprecated in 1.1 and will be removed in 1.3.

Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to effectively inspect more than max_features features.

random_stateint, RandomState instance or None, default=None

Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always randomly permuted at each split, even if splitter is set to ""best"". When max_features < n_features, the algorithm will select max_features at random at each split before finding the best split among them. But the best found split may vary across different runs, even if max_features=n_features. That is the case, if the improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting, random_state has to be fixed to an integer. See Glossary for details.

max_leaf_nodesint, default=None

Grow a tree with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

min_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0

A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.

The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:

N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)


where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child.

N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.

New in version 0.19.

class_weightdict, list of dict or “balanced”, default=None

Weights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.

Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].

The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))

For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

ccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0

Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than ccp_alpha will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning for details.

New in version 0.22.

Attributes:
classes_ndarray of shape (n_classes,) or list of ndarray

The classes labels (single output problem), or a list of arrays of class labels (multi-output problem).

feature_importances_ndarray of shape (n_features,)

Return the feature importances.

max_features_int

The inferred value of max_features.

n_classes_int or list of int

n_features_int

DEPRECATED: The attribute n_features_ is deprecated in 1.0 and will be removed in 1.2.

n_features_in_int

Number of features seen during fit.

New in version 0.24.

feature_names_in_ndarray of shape (n_features_in_,)

Names of features seen during fit. Defined only when X has feature names that are all strings.

New in version 1.0.

n_outputs_int

The number of outputs when fit is performed.

tree_Tree instance

The underlying Tree object. Please refer to help(sklearn.tree._tree.Tree) for attributes of Tree object and Understanding the decision tree structure for basic usage of these attributes.

See also

DecisionTreeRegressor

A decision tree regressor.

Notes

The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees (e.g. max_depth, min_samples_leaf, etc.) lead to fully grown and unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be controlled by setting those parameter values.

The predict method operates using the numpy.argmax function on the outputs of predict_proba. This means that in case the highest predicted probabilities are tied, the classifier will predict the tied class with the lowest index in classes_.

Predict class or regression value for X.

For a classification model, the predicted class for each sample in X is returned. For a regression model, the predicted value based on X is returned.

Parameters:
X{array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)

The input samples. Internally, it will be converted to dtype=np.float32 and if a sparse matrix is provided to a sparse csr_matrix.

check_inputbool, default=True

Allow to bypass several input checking. Don’t use this parameter unless you know what you do.

Returns:
yarray-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)

The predicted classes, or the predict values.

predict_log_proba(X)
[source]

Predict class log-probabilities of the input samples X.

Parameters:
X{array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)

The input samples. Internally, it will be converted to dtype=np.float32 and if a sparse matrix is provided to a sparse csr_matrix.

Returns:
probandarray of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or list of n_outputs such arrays if n_outputs > 1

The class log-probabilities of the input samples. The order of the classes corresponds to that in the attribute classes_.

predict_proba(X, check_input=True)
[source]

Predict class probabilities of the input samples X.

The predicted class probability is the fraction of samples of the same class in a leaf.

Parameters:
X{array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)

The input samples. Internally, it will be converted to dtype=np.float32 and if a sparse matrix is provided to a sparse csr_matrix.

check_inputbool, default=True

Allow to bypass several input checking. Don’t use this parameter unless you know what you do.

Returns:
probandarray of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or list of n_outputs such arrays if n_outputs > 1

The class probabilities of the input samples. The order of the classes corresponds to that in the attribute classes_.

score(X, y, sample_weight=None)
[source]

Return the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels.

In multi-label classification, this is the subset accuracy which is a harsh metric since you require for each sample that each label set be correctly predicted.

Parameters:
Xarray-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)

Test samples.

yarray-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)

True labels for X.

Sample weights.

Returns:
scorefloat

Mean accuracy of self.predict(X) wrt. y.

set_params(**params)
[source]

Set the parameters of this estimator.

The method works on simple estimators as well as on nested objects (such as Pipeline). The latter have parameters of the form <component>__<parameter> so that it’s possible to update each component of a nested object.

Parameters:
**paramsdict

Estimator parameters.

Returns:
selfestimator instance

Estimator instance.

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")

Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2"")) 
# Supprimer les ponctuations

 Changer la langue d'interface de R
Bonjour,


Juste une petite question sur la langue d'interface de R.
J'ai installé R en choisissant l'anglais comme langue d'installation et pourtant je l'ai en français !
Peut-on changer la langue et la mettre en anglais par exemple? Comment faire?

Merci et très bonne journée

salut,
pour choisir la langue de ta console il faut regarder dans :\Program Files\R\R-version\etc, puis tu modifie la langue dans le fichier ""Rconsole"" :


## Language for messages
language = en

Voilà.

La matrice des mots (term-documents matrix) est une table contenant la fréquence des mots. La fonction TermDocumentMatrix() du package text mining peut être utilisée comme suit :

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
head(d, 10)

freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe

wordcloud2(demoFreq, color = ""random-light"", backgroundColor = ""grey"")

png

Example2: use rotations
wordcloud2(demoFreq, minRotation = -pi/6, maxRotation = -pi/6, minSize = 10,
  rotateRatio = 1)
Example3: use figure file as a mask.

For example, t.png is A BIRD with black and white: 

figPath = system.file(""examples/t.png"",package = ""wordcloud2"")
wordcloud2(demoFreq, figPath = figPath, size = 1.5,color = ""skyblue"")

The Wordcloud2 library


 
 
 

This post explains how to draw wordclouds with R and the wordcloud2 package. It provides several reproducible examples with explanation and R code. It is largely inspired from the very well done vignette.

WORDCLOUD SECTION WARNING
Most basic with wordcloud2()

This is the most basic barplot you can build with the wordcloud2 library, using its wordcloud2() function. Note:

data is a data frame including word and freq in each column
size is the font size, default is 1.

# library
library(wordcloud2) 
 
# have a look to the example dataset
# head(demoFreq)

# Basic plot
wordcloud2(data=demoFreq, size=1.6)
Color & Background color

It is possible to change the word color using the color argument. You can provide a vector of color, or use random-dark or random-light. You can also customize the background color with backgroundColor.

# library
library(wordcloud2) 
 
# Gives a proposed palette
wordcloud2(demoFreq, size=1.6, color='random-dark')
 
# or a vector of colors. vector must be same length than input data
wordcloud2(demoFreq, size=1.6, color=rep_len( c(""green"",""blue""), nrow(demoFreq) ) )
 
# Change the background color
wordcloud2(demoFreq, size=1.6, color='random-light', backgroundColor=""black"")
Shape

You can custom the wordcloud shape using the shape argument. Available shapes are:

circle
cardioid
diamond
triangle-forward
triangle
pentagon
star

You can also use an image like this one as a mask.

# library
library(wordcloud2) 
 
# Change the shape:
wordcloud2(demoFreq, size = 0.7, shape = 'star')
 
# Change the shape using your image
wordcloud2(demoFreq, figPath = ""~/Desktop/R-graph-gallery/img/other/peaceAndLove.jpg"", size = 1.5, color = ""skyblue"", backgroundColor=""black"")
Word orientation

Rotate words with 3 arguments: minRotation, maxRotation and rotateRatio.

# library

# load wordcloud2
library(wordcloud2) 

# install webshot
library(webshot)
webshot::install_phantomjs()

# Make the graph
my_graph <- wordcloud2(demoFreq, size=1.5)

# save it in html
library(""htmlwidgets"")
saveWidget(my_graph,""tmp.html"",selfcontained = F)

# and in png or pdf

Getting Japanese characters to display in R Shiny

Our users have RStudio installed on their local machines and are using Shiny to filter data and exporting dataframes to an .xlsx file.

This works really well for most characters, but not when it comes to the Japanese and Mandarin ones. For those, they get to see ??????? instead of the actual text.

Data is residing in a SQL DB and we're using RODBC to connect to DB.

RODBC doesn't seem to like reading these Japanese and Mandarin characters. Is there a way to get around this?

Any help is much appreciated!

Thanks

I had a similar problem with french language the other day. Maybe these options can help you :

In RStudio, try going in Tool > Global Options > Code > Saving > and then choose the right encoding for Japanese and Mandarin. The UTF-8 enconding might work for you.
The blog post Escaping from character encoding hell in R on Windows explains how to set the encoding to import external documents. It should work with data imported with RODBC as well. The autor uses Japanese characters in his examples.
In the odbcDriverConnect() function of the RODBC package, the argument DBMSencoding=""UTF-8"" might work for you.

Our users have RStudio installed on their local machines and are using Shiny to filter data and exporting dataframes to an .xlsx file.

This works really well for most characters, but not when it comes to the Japanese and Mandarin ones. For those, they get to see ??????? instead of the actual text.

Data is residing in a SQL DB and we're using RODBC to connect to DB.

RODBC doesn't seem to like reading these Japanese and Mandarin characters. Is there a way to get around this?

Any help is much appreciated!

Thanks

I had a similar problem with french language the other day. Maybe these options can help you :

In RStudio, try going in Tool > Global Options > Code > Saving > and then choose the right encoding for Japanese and Mandarin. The UTF-8 enconding might work for you.

Our users have RStudio installed on their local machines and are using Shiny to filter data and exporting dataframes to an .xlsx file.

This works really well for most characters, but not when it comes to the Japanese and Mandarin ones. For those, they get to see ??????? instead of the actual text.

Data is residing in a SQL DB and we're using RODBC to connect to DB.

RODBC doesn't seem to like reading these Japanese and Mandarin characters. Is there a way to get around this?

Any help is much appreciated!

Thanks

Our users have RStudio installed on their local machines and are using Shiny to filter data and exporting dataframes to an .xlsx file.

This works really well for most characters, but not when it comes to the Japanese and Mandarin ones. For those, they get to see ??????? instead of the actual text.

Data is residing in a SQL DB and we're using RODBC to connect to DB.

RODBC doesn't seem to like reading these Japanese and Mandarin characters. Is there a way to get around this?

Any help is much appreciated!

Thanks

You can set this using the Sys.setenv() function. My R session defaults to English, so I'll set it to French and then back again:

> Sys.setenv(LANG = ""fr"")
> 2 + x
Erreur : objet 'x' introuvable
> Sys.setenv(LANG = ""en"")
> 2 + x
Error: object 'x' not found


A list of the abbreviations can be found here.

Sys.getenv() gives you a list of all the environment variables that are set.

This changes the Lang temporarily(during the R session). To change it once for all , you need to add the environment variable to your system, and relaunch RStudio so thistake effect. –

In the case of RStudio for Windows I succeeded in changing the language following the instructions found in R for Windows FAQ, in particular I wrote:

language = EN


inside the file Rconsole (in my installation it is C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.2\etc\Rconsole); this works also for the command Rscript.

For example you can locate the Rconsole file with this two commands from a command prompt:

cd \

dir Rconsole /s

The first one make the root as the current directory, the second one looks for the Rconsole file.

In the following screenshot you have that Rconsole file is in the folder C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.1\etc.

You may have more than one location, in that case you may edit all the Rconsole files.

After that you can open the Rconsole file with your favorite editor and look for the line language = and then append EN at the end of that line.

In the following screenshot the interesting line is the number 70 and you have to append EN at the end of it.

Does not work for me. Changing the file and setting the language to EN has no effect on the language of error messages. I can see that it would be logical for this to work, but I assume that in the meantime Windows has several other language configuration directives (maybe the system's language, the system's keyboard layout) that interact in complex and intransparent ways. –

For mac users, I found this on the R for Mac FAQ

If you use a non-standard setup (e.g. different language than formats), you can override the auto-detection performed by setting `force.LANG' defaults setting, such as for example

 defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8 


when run in Terminal it will enforce US-english setting regardless of the system setting. If you don't know what Terminal is you can use this R command instead:

 system(""defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8"") 


but do not forget to quit R and start R.app again afterwards. Please note that you must always use `.UTF-8' version of the locale, otherwise R.app will not work properly.

This helped me to change my console language from Chinese to English.

if one runs R directly from the command line, the answer above can be written inside the .bash_profile file (in Mac OS). Then, just type source .bash_profile to make the change effective in the window. obs: assuming pwd is ~, i.e. home directory. –

If you use Ubuntu you will set

This is true but not very helpful since you have to edit that file from the terminal. For noobs like me googling this here is how: type sudo nano /etc/R/Renviron.site into the terminal, followed by your password when the terminal asks you for it. Then you can edit that file right in the terminal. Add the line linellobocki mentions, then push ctrl + x to exit. Then type y to confirm that you want to save changes and hit enter to confirm the name and directory of the file. –

You may also want to be aware of the difference between, for example, Sys.setenv(LANG = ""ru"") and Sys.setlocale(locale = ""ru_RU.utf8"").

> Sys.setlocale(locale = ""ru_RU.utf8"")
[1] ""LC_CTYPE=ru_RU.utf8;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=ru_RU.utf8;LC_COLLATE=ru_RU.utf8;LC_MONETARY=ru_RU.utf8;LC_MESSAGES=en_IE.utf8;LC_PAPER=en_IE.utf8;LC_NAME=en_IE.utf8;LC_ADDRESS=en_IE.utf8;LC_TELEPHONE=en_IE.utf8;LC_MEASUREMENT=en_IE.utf8;LC_IDENTIFICATION=en_IE.utf8""


If you are interested in changing the behaviour of functions that refer to one of these elements (e.g strptime to extract dates), you should use Sys.setlocale(). See ?Sys.setlocale for more details. In order to see all available languages on a linux system, you can run

system(""locale -a"", intern = TRUE)

For me worked:

Sys.setlocale(""LC_MESSAGES"", ""en_US.utf8"")


Testing:

> Sys.setlocale(""LC_MESSAGES"", ""en_US.utf8"")
[1] ""en_US.utf8""
> x[3]
Error: object 'x' not found


Also working to get english messages:

Sys.setlocale(""LC_MESSAGES"", ""C"")


To reset to german messages I used

Sys.setlocale(""LC_MESSAGES"", ""de_DE.utf8"")


Here is the start of my sessionInfo:

To permanently make it works, in both R and Rstudio (with Win 10), one way to do this is to run the script every time automatically in the background initially.

No more changing the system language that influence the windows. No more R only but fail in Rstudio. No more run a script every time manually. No more admin right but fail. No more short-cut setting but fail.

Step 1. Use your system search, to find the file named ""Rprofile""

My response is

C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.5\library\base\R

C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.5\etc

Step 2. Edit C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.5\library\base\R\Rprofile

The content:

This is the system Rprofile file. It is always run on startup.
Additional commands can be placed in site or user Rprofile files
(see ?Rprofile) ... and so on.

Step 3. Add Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE=""en"") at the end of the scrip

local({
    Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE=""en"")
})


P.S. If you encounter the issue of authorization/saving, move this file to desktop and replace the original file after editing.

type this first: system(""defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8"") then you will get a index number(in my case is 127)

then type: Sys.setenv(LANG = ""en"") then type the number and ENTER 127

A simple solution would be setting export Lang=C in your bash script. I had a similar issue where the default language was german so it reverted back to english.

This is a good solution. I'm running R using anaconda and your solution worked for me. –

If you want to change R's language in terminal to English forever, this works fine for me in macOS:

Open terminal.app, and say:

touch .bash_profile


Then say:

open -a TextEdit.app .bash_profile


These two commands will help you open "".bash_profile"" file in TextEdit.

Add this to "".bash_profile"" file:

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8


Then save the file, reopen terminal and type R, you will find it's language has changed to english.

If you want language come back to it's original, just simply add a # before export LANG=en_US.UTF-8.

The only thing that worked for me was uninstalling R entirely (make sure to remove it from the Programs files as well), and install it, but unselect Message Translations during the installation process. When I installed R, and subsequently RCmdr, it finally came up in English.

This worked for me with a windows 10 laptop in German, where I wanted i.e. lubridate to return dates in English:

Sys.setlocale(""LC_TIME"", ""English"")

Im using R Studio on a Mac and I couldn't find the Rconsole file. So I took a more brutal way and just deleted the unwanted language files from the R app. You just have to go to your Rapp in your application Folder, right click, show package content then /contents/Resources/. There are the language files e.g. English.lproj or in my case de.lproj wich I deleted. After restarting R, error messages appear in English.. Maybe thats helpful!

you simply have to change the basic language of microsoft on your computer!

press the windows button together with r, and tip the following code into the window that is opened

control.exe /name Microsoft.Language

load the language package you want to use and change the options. but take care, this will change also your keyboard layout!

on windows, when you have no admin right, just create a new program shortcut to Rgui.exe. Then in the properties of that shortcut, go to the 'Shortcut' tab and modify the target to include the system language of your choice, e.g. ""C:\Program Files\R\R-3.5.3\bin\x64\Rgui.exe"" LANGUAGE=en

install wordcloud2
wordlcoud2 function
Parameters
Example1: use color and backgroundcolor
Example2: use rotations
Example3: use figure file as a mask.
letterCloud function
Parameters
shiny

This is an introduction to wordcloud2 package. This package provides an HTML5 interface to wordcloud for data visualization. Timdream’s wordcloud2.js is used in this package. 

This document show two main function in Wordcloud2:

wordcloud2: provide traditional wordcloud with HTML5
letterCloud: provide wordcloud with selected word(letters).
install wordcloud2

You may have installed this package. Well, I still want to leave these codes here for installing.

require(devtools)
install_github(""lchiffon/wordcloud2"")
wordlcoud2 function

You can use wordcloud directly:

library(wordcloud2)
wordcloud2(data = demoFreq)

demoFreq is a data.frame including word and freq in each column.

head(demoFreq)
##          word freq
## oil       oil   85
## said     said   73
## prices prices   48
## opec     opec   42
## mln       mln   31
## the       the   26
Parameters
data
A data frame including word and freq in each column
size
Font size, default is 1. The larger size means the bigger word.
fontFamily

Font to use.
fontWeight

Font weight to use, e.g. normal, bold or 600
color

color of the text, keyword ‘random-dark’ and ‘random-light’ can be used. color vector is also supported in this param
minSize
A character string of the subtitle
backgroundColor
Color of the background.
gridSize

Size of the grid in pixels for marking the availability of the canvas the larger the grid size, the bigger the gap between words.
minRotation
If the word should rotate, the minimum rotation (in rad) the text should rotate.
maxRotation
If the word should rotate, the maximum rotation (in rad) the text should rotate. Set the two value equal to keep all text in one angle.
rotateRatio
Probability for the word to rotate. Set the number to 1 to always rotate.
shape

The shape of the “cloud” to draw. Can be a keyword present. Available presents are ‘circle’ (default), ‘cardioid’ (apple or heart shape curve, the most known polar equation), ‘diamond’ (alias of square), ‘triangle-forward’, ‘triangle’, ‘pentagon’, and ‘star’.
ellipticity
degree of “flatness” of the shape wordcloud2.js should draw.
figPath
A fig used for the wordcloud.
widgetsize

size of the widgets
Example1: use color and backgroundcolor
wordcloud2(demoFreq, color = ""random-light"", backgroundColor = ""grey"")

png

Example2: use rotations
wordcloud2(demoFreq, minRotation = -pi/6, maxRotation = -pi/6, minSize = 10,
  rotateRatio = 1)
Example3: use figure file as a mask.

For example, t.png is A BIRD with black and white: 

figPath = system.file(""examples/t.png"",package = ""wordcloud2"")
wordcloud2(demoFreq, figPath = figPath, size = 1.5,color = ""skyblue"")

png

letterCloud function

letterCloud provide the function to create a wordcloud with a word, like this:

letterCloud(demoFreq, word = ""R"", size = 2)

Or:

letterCloud(demoFreq, word = ""WORDCLOUD2"", wordSize = 1)

 wordcloud with fig and letterCloud may disappeared in Rstudio Viewer, open into brower when you meet this bug

Parameters
data

A data frame including word and freq in each column
word

A word to create shape for wordcloud.
wordSize
Parameter of the size of the word, default is 2.
letterFont

Letter font
...
Other parameters for wordcloud2 Go to wordcloud2 in the github to leave a comment or give this package a star.

See Example:

if(require(shiny)){
  library(wordcloud2)
   # Global variables can go here
   n <- 1

   # Define the UI
   ui <- bootstrapPage(
      numericInput('size', 'Size of wordcloud', n),
     wordcloud2Output('wordcloud2')
   )


   # Define the server code
   server <- function(input, output) {
      output$wordcloud2 <- renderWordcloud2({
      # wordcloud2(demoFreqC, size=input$size)
        wordcloud2(demoFreq, size=input$size)
      })
   }

Le principe du nuage de mots est basé sur une méthode d’analyse de textes qui nous permet de mettre en évidence les mots-clés les plus fréquemment utilisés dans un paragraphe de textes. Le nuage de mots est également appelé word cloud ou tag cloud en anglais. La procédure de création d’un nuage de mots est très simple avec le logiciel R si vous connaissez les différentes étapes à exécuter. Le package tm (pour text mining) et le package wordcloud (pour générer le nuage de mots clés) sont disponibles dans R pour nous aider à analyser des textes et de visualiser rapidement les mots-clés en nuage de mots.

L’objectif de ce tutoriel est d’expliquer les différentes étapes pour générer un nuage de mots à partir du logiciel R.

3 raisons pour lesquelles vous devriez utiliser des nuages de mots pour présenter vos textes
Le nuage de mots est une méthode puissante pour l’analyse de textes. Il ajoute de la simplicité et de la clarté. Les mots-clés les plus utilisés ressortent mieux dans un nuage de mots.
Le nuage de mots est un outil de communication puissant. Il est facile à comprendre, à partager et est percutant
Le nuage de mots est visuellement plus agréable qu’une table de données remplie de textes
Qui utilise les nuages de mots?
Les chercheurs: pour la présentation des données qualitatives
Les Marketers: pour mettre en évidence les besoins et les points d’insatisfaction des clients
Les enseignants: pour soutenir des sujets essentiels
Les politiciens et les journalistes
Les réseaux sociaux: pour collecter, analyser et partager les sentiments des utilisateurs
Les cinq principales étapes de la création d’un nuage de mots avec le logiciel R
Etape 1: Créez un fichier texte

Dans les exemples suivants, je vais analyser le discours de Martin Luther King (“I have a dream”), mais vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel autre texte :

Copiez et collez le texte dans un fichier texte (par exemple: ml.txt)
Enregistrez le fichier

Notez que, le texte doit être enregistré dans un fichier au format texte simple (.txt) en utilisant votre éditeur de texte favori.

Etape 2: Installer et charger les packages nécessaires

Les packages text mining (tm) et wordcloud sont nécessaires.

Ils peuvent être installés et chargés en utilisant le code de R ci-dessous:

# Installer
install.packages(""tm"")  # pour le text mining
install.packages(""SnowballC"") # pour le text stemming
install.packages(""wordcloud"") # générateur de word-cloud 
install.packages(""RColorBrewer"") # Palettes de couleurs
# Charger
library(""tm"")
library(""SnowballC"")
library(""wordcloud"")
library(""RColorBrewer"")
Etape 3 : Exploration de textes
Charger le texte

Le texte peut être chargé en utilisant la fonction Corpus() du package tm. Corpus est une liste de documents (dans notre cas, nous avons juste un seul fichier).

Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, j’ai chargé un fichier .txt disponible sur le site web STHDA. Vous pouvez utiliser n’importe quel fichier de votre ordinateur.

# Lire le fichier texte
filePath <- ""http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/example-files/martin-luther-king-i-have-a-dream-speech.txt""
text <- readLines(filePath)
# Charger les données comme un corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(text))

La fonction VectorSource() se charge de la création du corpus de textes (ensemble de vecteurs de textes)

Le contenu du document peut être consulté comme suit:

inspect(docs)
La transformation du texte

La transformation du texte est effectuée en utilisant la fonction tm_map() pour remplacer, par exemple, des caractères spéciaux non utiles.

Remplacer “/”, “@” et “|” avec un espace

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "" "", x))
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""/"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""@"")
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, ""\\|"")
Nettoyage du texte

La fonction tm_map() est utilisée pour supprimer les espaces inutiles, pour convertir le texte en minuscules, supprimer les “mots vides” (stopwords en anglais). Il s’agit des mots très courants dans une langue comme “le”, “la”, “nous”, “et”, etc.

La valeur de l’information de ces “mots vides” est proche de zéro en raison du fait qu’ils sont si communs dans une langue. La suppression de ce genre de mots est utile avant de poursuivre une analyse plus approfondie.

Pour la suppression de ces mots vides, les langues supportées sont: danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, hungarian, italian, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish et swedish. Le nom des langues est sensible à la casse.

Je vais aussi vous montrer comment faire pour supprimer votre propre liste de mots du texte.

Vous pouvez également supprimer des chiffres et ponctuations avec les arguments removeNumbers et removePunctuation.

Une autre étape importante de préparation du texte est de faire du texte stemming. Ce processus consiste à réduire les mots à leurs racines. En d’autres termes, ce processus supprime les suffixes des mots pour les rendre simples et pour obtenir l’origine commune. Par exemple, le text stemming va réduire les mots “partir”, “partant”, “partons” à la racine “partir”.

Notez que le text stemming nécessite le package ‘SnowballC’.

Le code R ci-dessous peut être utilisé pour nettoyer le texte :

# Convertir le texte en minuscule
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
# Supprimer les nombres
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
# Supprimer les mots vides anglais
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords(""english""))
# Supprimer votre propre liste de mots non désirés
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c(""blabla1"", ""blabla2"")) 
# Supprimer les ponctuations
docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)
# Supprimer les espaces vides supplémentaires
docs <- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace)
# Text stemming
# docs <- tm_map(docs, stemDocument)
Etape 4: Construire la matrice des mots

La matrice des mots (term-documents matrix) est une table contenant la fréquence des mots. La fonction TermDocumentMatrix() du package text mining peut être utilisée comme suit :

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
head(d, 10)
             word freq
will         will   17
freedom   freedom   13
ring         ring   12
day           day   11
dream       dream   11
let           let   11
every       every    9
able         able    8
one           one    8
together together    7
Etape 5: Générer le nuage de mots

L’importance des mots peut être illustrée par un nuage de mots comme suit:

set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, ""Dark2""))

Le nuage de mots ci-dessus montre clairement que les mots “Will”, “freedom”, “dream”, “day” et “together” sont les cinq mots les plus importants dans le texte “I have a dream” de Martin Luther King.

Les arguments de la fonction wordcloud sont :



words : les mots à dessiner
freq : la fréquence des mots
min.freq : les mots avec une fréquence en dessous de min.freq ne seront pas illustrés
max.words : nombre maximum de mots à dessiner
random.order : dessine les mots dans un ordre aléatoire. Si false, ils seront dessinés par ordre décroissant de la fréquence
rot.per : la proportion de mots verticaux sur le graphe
colors : couleurs des mots du moins au plus fréquent. Utiliser par exemple, colors =“black” pour une couleur unique.




Allez plus loin
Explorer les mots fréquents ainsi que leurs associations

Vous pouvez voir les mots les plus fréquents comme suit. L’exemple, ci-dessous, montre les mots qui sont fréquents au moins 4 fois dans le texte :

findFreqTerms(dtm, lowfreq = 4)
 [1] ""able""     ""day""      ""dream""    ""every""    ""faith""    ""free""     ""freedom""  ""let""      ""mountain"" ""nation""  
[11] ""one""      ""ring""     ""shall""    ""together"" ""will""    

Vous pouvez analyser l’association entre les mots (leur corrélation) en utilisant la fonction findAssocs(). Le code R ci-dessous identifie les mots qui sont le plus fréquemment associés à “freedom” dans le texte I have a dream :

findAssocs(dtm, terms = ""freedom"", corlimit = 0.3)
             freedom
let             0.89
ring            0.86
mississippi     0.34
mountainside    0.34
stone           0.34
every           0.32
mountain        0.32
state           0.32
Table de la fréquence des mots
head(d, 10)
             word freq
will         will   17
freedom   freedom   13
ring         ring   12
day           day   11
dream       dream   11
let           let   11
every       every    9
able         able    8
one           one    8
together together    7
Dessiner la fréquence des mots

La fréquence des 10 premiers mots est montré ci-dessous :

barplot(d[1:10,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = d[1:10,]$word,
        col =""lightblue"", main =""Most frequent words"",
        ylab = ""Word frequencies"")

As i almost reach my 40's i find myself keep coming back here every now and then. Every tune and lyrics and beat here keeps me on the right track everytime i get confused in life.. Nostalgia creeps through my veins and feels good to dance woth every drum beat.
